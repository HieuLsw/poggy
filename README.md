Poggy is a Watch app that let you trigger actions quickly with only a couple of taps.  
Why waste time typing the same message, when you can use Poggy?!

Once you created an action, it will be immediately accessible from the watch app or from the watch glance.  
Tap on the glance or on the Send button of the app and your action will be triggered.

Do you have an idea for a new action? Open an issue on GitHub or contact me directly.  
Want to collaborate or improve it? Please do it, fork the project and send me pull requests!
